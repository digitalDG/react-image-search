# Description

This application allows an user to enter a search term which returns a set of image results from the Pixabay API. The images are displayed as image gallarys.


# Project Dependencies

- Material UI V5
- Axios
- MUI Search Bar

# UI Design

The application consists of 3 main UI components.

- NavBar
- Search 
- ImageGallary

It uses custom hooks for resuable Axios calls, and context API to share data between components

# Design Tradeoffs

The Material UI component libarary was used to quickly create components. An existing search bar npm package was used to simplify developmnet efforts.


# App Improvements

- The ability for user login where users save favorites
- Ability to select favorites
- More search options selectable by user - per_page, safesearch
- Ability to select categories, image types
- Image pagination to view multiple pages
- share images
